* Formatting

* Text Highlighting

We can wrap around `*` (asterisk) instead of spaces to *bold*any*text*
We can wrap around `_` (underscore) instead of spaces to _italicize_any_text_
We can wrap around ``` (backtick) instead of spaces to `codify`any`text`

* Comments

# Preceeding comment
Comments can be added using # (hash)
# Trailing comment

* Bullet Points

- Points can be added using a `-` (hyphen) at column 1
- Spacing needs to be maintained for the points

* Change background

.background ./images/background_image.png

To change background of the slide we can use `.background` function.

For example this slide uses
`.background`./images/background_image.jpg`

* Speaker notes

Presenter notes may be enabled by appending the "-notes" flag when you run your "present" binary.

This will allow you to open a second window by pressing 'N' from your browser displaying your slides. 

The second window is completely synced with your main window, except that presenter notes are only visible on the second window.

* Adding code

* Showcase code

To injects program source by extracting code from files as HTML-escaped <pre> blocks we can use `.code` function. 

`.code`snippets/playground.go`
translates to:
.code snippets/playground.go

* Formatting the code injections

- Lines with OMIT are removed from the code injections

Comments are removed from injections
.code snippets/playground-with-comment.go 

* Formatting the code injections

- Subsetting the code can be done using regex

`.code`snippets/playground.go`/^func main/,/^}/`
translates to:

.code snippets/playground.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Formatting the code injections

- Displayed text can be highlighted using `//`HL` in the line end.

`.code`snippets/playground-with-highlight.go`
translates to:

.code snippets/playground-with-highlight.go 

* Formatting the code injections

- Highlights can also be done using code invocation.

Same program with HL invocation 
`.code`snippets/playground.go` `HL123`
translates to:
.code snippets/playground.go HL123

* Run code to show the results

.play snippets/playground.go

* Adding dynamic content

* Using image function

We can use `.image` function to showcase image

`.image`link/to/the/image`
translates to
.image https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558039719-79cb7b60d279?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=80

* Creating captions

We can use `.iframe`link/to/content`height`width` function to showcase dynamic content

Or we can use `.video`videos/video_name.mp4`video/format`height`width`

* Congratulations on getting rid of powerpoint for your presentation!
